//! Scheduler Timer for enforcing Process Timeslices

use crate::hil::time::{self, Frequency};

/// Interface for the system scheduler timer.
///
/// A system scheduler timer provides a countdown timer to enforce process
/// scheduling time quanta. Implementations should have consistent timing
/// while the CPU is active, but need not operate during sleep.
///
/// The primary requirement an implementation of this interface must satisfy is
/// it must be capable of generating an interrupt when the timer expires. This
/// interrupt will interrupt the executing process, returning control to the
/// kernel, and allowing the scheduler to make decisions about what to run next.
///
/// On most chips, this interface will be implemented by a core peripheral (e.g.
/// the ARM core SysTick peripheral). However, some chips lack this optional
/// peripheral, in which case it might be implemented by another timer or alarm
/// peripheral, or require virtualization on top of a shared hardware timer.
///
/// The `SchedulerTimer` interface is carefully designed to be rather general to
/// support the various implementations required on different hardware
/// platforms. The general operation is the kernel will start a timer, in effect
/// starting the time quantum assigned to a process. While the process is
/// running, it will arm the timer, indicating to the implementation to ensure
/// that an interrupt will occur when the time quantum is exhausted. When the
/// process has stopped running the timer will be disarmed, indicating that an
/// interrupt is no longer required. Note, many scheduler implementations also
/// charge time spent running the kernel against the process time quantum.
/// When the kernel needs to know if a process has exhausted its time quantum
/// it will call `has_expired()`.
///
/// Implementations must take care when using interrupts. Since the
/// `SchedulerTimer` is used in the core kernel loop and scheduler, top half
/// interrupt handlers may not have executed before `SchedulerTimer` functions
/// are called. In particular, implementations on top of virtualized timers may
/// receive the interrupt fired callback "late" (i.e. after the kernel calls
/// `has_expired()`). Implementations should ensure that they can reliably check for
/// timeslice expirations.
pub trait SchedulerTimer {
    /// Start a timer for a process timeslice.
    ///
    /// This must set a timer for an interval as close as possible to the given
    /// interval in microseconds. Interrupts do need to be enabled.
    ///
    /// Callers can assume at least a 24-bit wide clock. Specific timing is
    /// dependent on the driving clock. For ARM boards with a dedicated SysTick
    /// peripheral, increments of 10ms are most accurate thanks to additional
    /// hardware support for this value. ARM SysTick supports intervals up to
    /// 400ms.

    /// power state. Calling any function other than `start()` immediately after
    /// `reset()` is invalid.

    /// process.

    /// This does not stop the timer, but indicates to the SchedulerTimer that
    /// an interrupt is no longer required (i.e. the process is no longer
    /// executing). By not requiring an interrupt this may allow certain
    /// implementations to be more efficient by removing the overhead of
    /// handling the interrupt. The implementation may disable the underlying
    /// interrupt if one has been set, depending on the requirements of the
    /// implementation.

    /// called after it has returned `true` for a given timeslice until

    /// is called again after returning `true` without an intervening call to
    /// `start()`, the return the return value is unspecified and
    /// implementations may return whatever they like.
    ///

/// for that hardware peripheral without the alarm abstraction in between.
