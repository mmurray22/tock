## Updates to the Core Team

Periodically the member list of the core team is re-evaluated so that it stays
current with developers who are actively involved with the Tock project. Members
who are not actively developing Tock or reviewing pull requests will be retired
from the core team.

## Joining the Core Team

Contributors who are actively help develop Tock will be considered to join the
core team. Generally, a core team member:

- Understands the core design principles of Tock and is capable of judging the
  effect new code contributions will have on Tock's adherence to those
  principles.
- Understands the code style and structure of Tock and can help ensure a
  reasonably consistent code base.
- Understands Tock's various stakeholders and can judge how a change to Tock
  might affect various users of Tock.

A core team member is expected to:

- Help review a percentage of new pull requests to the Tock code base.
- Provide opinions and input on substantial design decisions or major changes to
  Tock.
- Help test Tock prior to releases.

To join the core team, a contributor must be nominated by an existing core team
member. The nominator will open a pull request updating this document with the
new core team member in the list above. That pull request will undergo the usual
pull request review, and the member will be added to the core team if the pull
request is merged.
