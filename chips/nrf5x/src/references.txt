& -> this is a regular reference to a regular string (i.e. immutable)

mut & -> this is a mutable reference to a mutable string
	-can only have one mutable reference to a piece of data in
	 a particular scope

	-also rules about combining mutable and immutable references
	to a mutable object

compiler guarantees dangling references: for example, cannot declare
string within function then return reference to string
